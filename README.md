## Information for running Project

# You will need:
* Clion
* Qt v6.1+
* GCC/MinGW/Compatible C++ Compiler

# Running the code:

This project requires Qt to be installed on the machine to compile. The link to download Qt can be found here (https://www.qt.io/download-dev), or it can be installed from the terminal. It is running on version 6.9.1, and it will run with v6.1 or above.

I've chosen CLion, which will work with the CMake files from download. I have only run this on MacOS, but from my research, the files should be compatible with Windows systems without any changes.
